# RACE CAR STIMULATION

This project has been a successful learning experience to practically use the functions defined
in OpenGL and to understand a variety of features and options present in it. This project clearly
demonstrated the richness of graphics library and its ability to make complex 3D images in a
very simple way. We intended to make maximum use of the OpenGL functions which we have
done to our satisfaction.
This project showed us a moving car with different views. The inclusion of textures,
complex shading and lighting models can make the planes more clear and colourful. The
project can be developed into a game by allowing the user to move the car using direction keys.
More number of cars can be added to get a real feeling of a race. This project is also helpful for
students of computer science to study the OpenGL functions in a better way.

This is the view of the project :
