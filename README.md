# RACE CAR STIMULATION
Computer Graphics has grown into a very important topic in the branch of Computer Science. This is due to
an effective and rapid communication formed between man and the machine. Human eye can absorb the
information in a displayed diagram or perspective diagram much faster than it can scan a page or a table of
contents.

This project demonstrates the creation of a moving racing car along with a circular race track and
scenery. The user is also given the option to see the car from different views. OpenGL is used to make this
possible by virtue of its various functionalities.

We make use of simple geometric figures like triangle, circle and polygons to construct the parts of racing
car and the track Cones, spheres and cylinders are used to generate the trees. We also include lighting and
material properties.

The code implemented makes use of various OpenGL functions for translation, rotation and keyboard
callback function, built-in functions for solids and many more.
